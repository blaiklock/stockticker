## Overview

The primary goal of this project is to learn Angular JS. In order to meet this goal I decided to build a simple stock ticker app that mimics what you would see on CNBC, Bloomberg, etc.

A secondary goal is to learn how to deploy this project as a desktop app using NW.js (formerly node-webkit).

A tertiary goal is to learn how to manage a GitHub repository.

The status of this repository is that the app should work in a browser locally or at thisproject.github.io. Several lines necessary to build this app using NW.js have been commented out. Figuring out the best way to manage this on GitHub is a todo.

## Features

- The ability to enter or update a list of stock tickers.
- Relies on Yahoo Finance for quote data.

## Special Thanks

- Jon Mifsuf for jQuery WebTicker ([github](https://github.com/jonmifsud/Web-Ticker)).
- David Sanchez for inspiration on colors ([github](https://github.com/David5i6/Brackets-Delkos-Dark-Theme)).
- Rabi Kiran ([website](http://sravi-kiran.blogspot.com/2013/05/ImplementingSignalRStockTickerUsingAngularJSPart2.html)).

## TODO

- Improve the animation of the ticker when the quotes are updated.
- Document how to deploy as NW.js app.
